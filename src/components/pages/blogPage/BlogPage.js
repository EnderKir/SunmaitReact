          Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in
          Spring! Can you believe we’re already staring down November? I can’t!
          (We’re just two months away from the new year!) This week I’m in
          Chicago for meetings, and then - finally - I’m off to San Francisco
          and see the family. Then, it’s off to Europe for the Devoxx Ukraine
          and Devoxx Belgium events. I can’t wait to see everyone there! I’m
          particularly looking forward to spending Halloween (on the 31st of
          October) in San Francisco with my kid. The entire family, including
          the dog, have Halloween costumes. We’re ready! (I’m going dressed as
          an application server.)
